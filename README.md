# Details

`seleniumgenic` has zero dependencies. It just takes in a given Selenium [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_WebDriver.html) instance and works with it's API. Since the suites of core Selenium packages are constantly updating and only work with the latest versions of browsers, it will be the aim to keep `seleniumgenic` always working with the latest versions of the [selenium-webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).
